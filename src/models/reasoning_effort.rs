/// pub ReasoningEffort : **o-series models only**   Constrains effort on reasoning for  [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.
